C Style Guide for the AVR
=========================

Style guides are have a tendency to grow long and arbitrary, and to frustrate
developers who just want to write code. Here at REVO, we want to minimize
frustration for you, but we're working with embedded systems, and it can be a 
real pain to debug code when all you can do is blink an LED. Hopefully these
guidelines will help you write code that is easy to read and easy to debug.
